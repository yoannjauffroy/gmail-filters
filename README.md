## Github

Edit the template with your information

In the template, replace the following string:

    @<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME_HERE> (in my case that would be @yoannjauffroy)

If you’re part of a GitHub team that other people mention in issues and pull requests, also replace the following string:

    @<YOUR_GITHUB_TEAM_NAME_HERE> (for example, @my-organization/best-team-ever)
    
If you're part of more one team, you can duplicate the <entry> node and change the team name

If you’re not part of a GitHub team, remove the <entry> node that looks for this pattern.

Finally, save the XML file.
